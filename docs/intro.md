# Preface by Logic Devil

I decided to write this book on how to prepare for technical interviews to share my learnings and insights. The purpose of this book is by no means to proove or explain the algorithms and data structures in detail. It is to go over the necessary data structures and algorithms and show how to apply them to solve commonly asked questions in their tech interviews.
