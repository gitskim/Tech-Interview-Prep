# Tree Practice Problems
**NOTE**: come up with solutions in at least 2 ways, if possible. . Ideally **recursively** and **iteratively**.

## Tree Construction
[Insert into a Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-into-a-binary-search-tree/)
[Delete Node in a BST](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-bst/)


## Recursion practice
[Count the number of nodes in the tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-complete-tree-nodes/)
[Max depth of a binary tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/)

Given a non-empty binary search tree - an ordered binary tree, return the minimum data value found in that tree.

[hasPathSum](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum/)
[print binary tree paths](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-paths/)
[invert BT - Change the tree into its mirror image] (https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree/)
[Same tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/same-tree/)
[Validate binary search tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/)

For each node in a binary search tree, create a new duplicate node, and insert the duplicate as the left child of the original node. The resulting tree should still be a binary search tree.


## Extra tree
[BST Right Side View](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-right-side-view/)
[Convert BST to a greater tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-bst-to-greater-tree/)
[Validate BST](https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/)
